#  Module for File Extraction

This is a Zeek package that provides convenient extraction of files.

As a secondary goal, this script performs additional commonly requested file extraction and logging tasks, such as naming extracted files after their calculated file checksum or naming the file with its common file extension.

## Installing with zkg (preferred)

This package can be installed through the [zeek package manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html) by utilizing the following commands:

```sh
zkg install zeek/hosom/file-extraction

# you must separately load the package for it to actually do anything
zkg load zeek/hosom/file-extraction
```

## Installing manually

While not preferred, this package can also be installed manually. To do this, follow the tasks below:

```
cd <prefix>/share/zeek/site

git clone git://github.com/hosom/file-extraction file-extraction

echo "@load file-extraction" >> local.zeek
```

## Configuration

The package installs with the **extract-common-exploit-types.zeek** policy, however, additional functionality may be desired. 

Configuration must **always be done within the config.zeek** file. Failure to isolate configuration to **config.zeek** will result in your configuration being overwritten.

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration of file extraction, the best option available is to hook the FileExtraction::extract hook. For examples of this, look at the scripts in the plugins directory.
